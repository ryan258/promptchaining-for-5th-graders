# requirements.txt - The Tools We Need
# This file tells Python which extra tools to download and install
# Think of it like a shopping list for our code

# google-generativeai - This is the main tool that lets us talk to Google's Gemini AI models
# It's like having a universal translator for Google's AI languages
# This is much more affordable than other AI options, perfect for learning!

# python-dotenv - This helps us keep our secret keys safe
# It reads passwords from a file called .env instead of putting them in our code
# This way we can share our code without sharing our secret passwords
python-dotenv

# pytest - This is our testing tool
# It runs all our tests to make sure our code works correctly
# Think of it like a robot that checks our work for us
pytest

# pydantic - This helps us create clean, organized data structures
# It's like having labeled boxes for our data, so everything stays organized
# It also checks that the data is the right type (text vs number vs etc.)
