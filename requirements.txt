# requirements.txt - The Tools We Need
# This file tells Python which extra tools to download and install
# Think of it like a shopping list for our code

# llm - This is the main tool that lets us talk to AI models
# It's like having a universal translator for different AI languages
# Without this, we can't send prompts to Claude, GPT, or other AI models
llm

# python-dotenv - This helps us keep our secret keys safe
# It reads passwords from a file called .env instead of putting them in our code
# This way we can share our code without sharing our secret passwords
python-dotenv

# llm-claude-3 - This is a special add-on for the llm tool
# It teaches the llm tool how to specifically talk to Claude AI models
# Without this, the llm tool wouldn't know how to speak "Claude language"
llm-claude-3

# pytest - This is our testing tool
# It runs all our tests to make sure our code works correctly
# Think of it like a robot that checks our work for us
pytest

# pydantic - This helps us create clean, organized data structures
# It's like having labeled boxes for our data, so everything stays organized
# It also checks that the data is the right type (text vs number vs etc.)
pydantic
