# Archived Documentation

This directory contains older documentation files that have been superseded by the consolidated README.md in the project root.

## Archived Files

- **HAPPY-PATH.md** - Original beginner-friendly quick start guide (now merged into main README)
- **GETTING_STARTED.md** - Original installation and setup guide (now merged into main README)
- **PROMPTING.md** - Prompting strategy notes (superseded by tool implementations)
- **ROADMAP.md** - Original project roadmap (see IDEAS.md for current plans)
- **RMAP.md, RMAP-CS.md, QS-CS.md, RME.md** - Planning documents from early development
- **TEMPLATE.md** - Template for creating new tools
- **review.md** - Early project notes

## Why Archived?

These files were consolidated into a single, comprehensive README.md to:
- Reduce cognitive load for new users
- Eliminate redundant information
- Provide a single source of truth
- Keep the project root clean and focused

## Current Documentation

See the main [README.md](../../README.md) in the project root for up-to-date documentation.
