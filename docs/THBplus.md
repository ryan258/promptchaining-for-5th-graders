For someone in their 30s. Synthesize research from multiple domains. Be specific and actionable. Consider circadian rhythms, willpower depletion, habit formation, stress hormones, and social connection.
```

**Cognitive moves:** decompose, connect, synthesize, apply

**Why it wows:**
1. Extremely practical - everyone wants this
2. Synthesizes multiple scientific domains
3. The prompts it designs are sophisticated
4. The final routine is actually useful and science-backed
5. About 8-10 specific recommendations with reasoning
6. People screenshot the results to use themselves

**Typical output includes:**
- Wake time based on circadian rhythms
- Morning light exposure for cortisol awakening response
- Cold shower timing for norepinephrine
- Protein timing for satiety and muscle protein synthesis
- Social connection before solo work (oxytocin → productivity)
- When to have coffee (90min after waking, not immediately)
- Movement before cognitively demanding work (BDNF)

**After this demo, people say:** "Can I use this? Can you send me the results?"

## 🎯 How to Choose Your "WOW" Example

**Match to your audience:**

**For parents:**
- "Why does music give us chills"
- "How did Greeks calculate Earth's circumference"
- "Why breakfast might not be the most important meal"

**For younger folks:**
- "Are we in a simulation" debate
- "Do LLMs understand" debate
- "Future of work" debate

**For intellectuals:**
- "Consciousness emerges from quantum processes"
- "What is the hard problem of consciousness"
- "Free will is an illusion" Socratic dialogue

**For health-conscious people:**
- "Cold showers boost immune function"
- "Gut microbiome influences mood"
- "Optimal morning routine" meta-chain

**For the "I'm skeptical of AI" crowd:**
- "Placebo effect produces physiological changes" (shows nuance)
- Emergence compare on ANY topic (shows methodology matters)
- Scientific method on anything (shows rigorous reasoning)

**For maximum drama:**
- Any Red vs Blue debate - the winner reveal is always climactic
- "Simulation hypothesis" is the most entertaining
- "AI will replace knowledge work" hits closest to home

## 💥 The Nuclear Option

**If you really want to blow minds and have 10 minutes:**

**Do THIS sequence:**

1. **Concept Simplifier:** "Why does time slow down near a black hole"
   - Gets them intellectually engaged
   - Shows impressive analogies

2. **Meta-Chain:** "Optimal morning routine for peak performance"
   - Shows practical value
   - Demonstrates complex synthesis
   - Everyone wants the results

3. **Red vs Blue:** "We are living in a computer simulation"
   - Maximum entertainment value
   - Philosophically mind-bending
   - Ends with dramatic verdict

**This sequence:**
- Starts with cosmic wonder (black holes)
- Shifts to personal practical (morning routine)
- Ends with existential "whoa" (simulation)
- Takes them on a journey from physics → neuroscience → philosophy
- Showcases 3 totally different capabilities

**After this, they'll remember your demo forever.**
