# Prompt Chaining Framework

> **Build AI systems that think in steps, not shots.**

A Python framework for creating sequential LLM workflows where each step builds on previous discoveries. Turn complex reasoning tasks that would fail as single prompts into reliable, emergent multi-step processes.

---

## 🎯 What Is This?

This framework lets you chain multiple LLM prompts together where **each step can reference outputs from previous steps**. This unlocks reasoning patterns impossible with single prompts.

**Quick Example:**

```python
from chain import MinimalChainable
from main import build_models, prompt

client, models = build_models()

result, _, _, _ = MinimalChainable.run(
    context={"topic": "Neural Networks"},
    model=(client, models[0]),
    callable=prompt,
    return_trace=True,
    prompts=[
        "Break down {{topic}} into 3-5 core components",
        "For each component in {{output[-1]}}, create a simple analogy",
        "Using {{output[-2]}} and {{output[-1]}}, write a 5th-grade explanation",
    ]
)

print(result[-1])  # Final explanation built from previous insights
```

**Why This Works:**
- Step 1 identifies the essential pieces
- Step 2 creates analogies for those *specific* pieces
- Step 3 synthesizes insights from both previous steps

This sequential reasoning **cannot work as a single prompt** because later steps depend on discoveries from earlier ones.

## 💡 Why Prompt Chaining?

### The Problem with Single Prompts

Single prompts are limited by:
- **Working memory constraints** - Can't hold complex analysis + synthesis simultaneously
- **No iteration** - Can't refine based on intermediate results
- **No emergent insights** - Can't discover connections that require multi-step reasoning

### What Chaining Unlocks

✨ **Emergent Insights** - Later steps reveal connections impossible to specify upfront
🔄 **Self-Refinement** - Critique and improve intermediate outputs
🎯 **Progressive Depth** - Start broad, zoom into specifics, then synthesize
🧬 **Complex Reasoning** - Break down problems that overwhelm single-shot thinking
🔀 **Multi-Perspective** - Analyze from different angles, then integrate
💡 **Discovery-Driven** - Each step builds on *what was actually discovered*, not just *what you planned*

### Real Example: The Concept Simplifier

This tool **cannot work as a single prompt**:

```
1. Decompose → Identify core components
2. Analogize → Create metaphors for THOSE components
3. Exemplify → Build examples using THOSE analogies
4. Synthesize → Combine everything into coherent explanation
```

Each step depends on *discoveries* from previous steps. You can't write the analogies until you know the components. You can't synthesize until you have both.

**The chain IS the insight.**

## ⚙️ Core Capabilities

### 1. Sequential Chaining (MinimalChainable)

Run prompts in sequence, each building on previous outputs:

```python
from chain import MinimalChainable
from main import build_models, prompt

client, models = build_models()
model = (client, models[0])

result, prompts, usage, trace = MinimalChainable.run(
    context={"topic": "Recursion"},
    model=model,
    callable=prompt,
    return_trace=True,
    prompts=[
        "Define {{topic}} in one sentence",
        "Give 2 examples of {{output[-1]}}",
        "Explain why {{output[-2]}} is powerful in programming"
    ]
)

# result is a list of outputs from each step
# result[-1] is the final output
```

**Features:**
- `{{variable}}` - Context substitution
- `{{output[-1]}}` - Reference previous output
- `{{output[-1].field}}` - Extract JSON fields
- Automatic logging to `logs/`
- Full execution traces

### 2. Parallel Comparison (FusionChain)

Run the same chain across multiple models and compare results:

```python
from chain import FusionChain

def evaluator(responses):
    # Your custom scoring logic
    scores = [len(r) for r in responses]
    max_score = max(scores)
    normalized = [s/max_score for s in scores]
    best = responses[scores.index(max_score)]
    return best, normalized

result = FusionChain.run(
    context={"topic": "AI Safety"},
    models=[(client, name) for name in model_names],
    callable=prompt,
    evaluator=evaluator,
    get_model_name=lambda m: m[1],
    prompts=[...]
)

print(f"Best response: {result.top_response}")
print(f"Model scores: {result.performance_scores}")
```

### 3. Artifact System (Persistent Knowledge)

Save and reuse outputs across chains:

```python
from artifact_store import ArtifactStore

store = ArtifactStore()

# Chains automatically store outputs
result, _, _, _ = MinimalChainable.run(
    context={"topic": "Machine Learning"},
    model=model,
    callable=prompt,
    artifact_store=store,
    topic="machine_learning",
    prompts=[...]
)

# Later, reference those artifacts in new chains
prompts = [
    "Using {{artifact:machine_learning:components}}, explain supervised learning"
]
```

**Artifacts enable:**
- Cross-chain knowledge sharing
- Building on previous work
- Avoiding redundant analysis
- Progressive knowledge accumulation

### 4. Chain Composition (ChainComposer)

Build complex multi-chain workflows programmatically:

```python
from chain_composer import ChainComposer, ChainStep

composer = ChainComposer()

# Define a multi-chain workflow
steps = [
    ChainStep(
        name="Analyze concept",
        prompts=["Break down {{topic}} into components"],
        creates_artifact="components"
    ),
    ChainStep(
        name="Create curriculum",
        prompts=["Design a learning path for {{artifact:components}}"],
        depends_on=["components"]
    )
]

result = composer.compose(
    steps=steps,
    context={"topic": "Neural Networks"},
    model=model
)
```

### 5. Meta-Chain Generator (Self-Improving)

The system can design its own chains:

```python
from meta_chain_generator import MetaChainGenerator

generator = MetaChainGenerator()

# Describe what you want, get a chain that does it
chain = generator.design_chain(
    task="Analyze a business idea for feasibility",
    cognitive_moves=["decompose", "critique", "synthesize"],
    depth=4
)

# Run the generated chain
result = chain.execute(
    context={"idea": "AI-powered meal planning app"}
)
```

The meta-chain analyzes your task and generates optimal prompt sequences automatically.

## 🔬 Advanced Features

### Execution Traces

Get complete visibility into chain execution:

```python
result, prompts, usage, trace = MinimalChainable.run(
    return_trace=True,
    prompts=[...]
)

# trace contains:
{
    "steps": [
        {
            "step_number": 1,
            "role": "Educator",
            "prompt": "...",
            "response": "...",
            "tokens": {"prompt": 50, "completion": 200}
        }
    ],
    "final_result": {...},
    "total_tokens": 500
}
```

### Automatic Logging

All chains automatically log to `logs/` with:
- Timestamped filename
- All prompts and responses
- Token usage per step
- Total execution time
- Markdown formatted for readability

### Cognitive Move Patterns

The framework recognizes common reasoning patterns:

- **decompose** - Break complex things into parts
- **analogize** - Create metaphors and comparisons
- **exemplify** - Generate concrete examples
- **synthesize** - Combine insights into coherent whole
- **critique** - Evaluate and find flaws
- **abstract** - Generalize from specifics
- **apply** - Take theory to practice
- **connect** - Find relationships between ideas

These can be composed into powerful chains.

### Recipe System

Save and reuse chain patterns:

```python
# Create a recipe
recipe = {
    "name": "Concept Comparison",
    "steps": [
        {"name": "Analyze A", "prompts": [...]},
        {"name": "Analyze B", "prompts": [...]},
        {"name": "Compare", "prompts": [...]}
    ]
}

# Use the recipe with different inputs
result = run_recipe(recipe, context={"A": "Python", "B": "JavaScript"})
```

## ⚠️ Ethical Note

This framework enables powerful analytical tools. Some patterns reveal uncomfortable truths about persuasion, manipulation, and strategic deception.

**Understanding ≠ Endorsing**

These patterns exist whether you acknowledge them or not. This knowledge is for:
- ✅ **Defense** - See through manipulation
- ✅ **Awareness** - Make better decisions
- ✅ **Education** - Understand how systems work

Not for:
- ❌ **Offense** - Deploy manipulative tactics
- ❌ **Deception** - Mislead others
- ❌ **Harm** - Cause damage

Use responsibly.
