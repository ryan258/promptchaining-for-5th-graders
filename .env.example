# .env.example - The Secrets Template
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your real keys
# Think of this as a treasure map without the actual treasure marked

# ============================================================================
# THE PHILOSOPHY OF SECRETS
# ============================================================================
# This file serves a beautiful dual purpose:
# 1. It shows what secrets your application needs (the shape of trust)
# 2. It keeps the actual secrets safe (the substance of security)
# 
# It's like showing someone the lock without giving them the key.

# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUNG BUILDERS
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. COPY THIS FILE:
#    cp .env.example .env
#
# 2. GET YOUR OPENROUTER API KEY:
#    - Visit https://openrouter.ai/keys
#    - Sign in (can use Google, GitHub, or email)
#    - Click "Create Key"
#    - Give it a name like "promptchaining-learning"
#    - Copy the key that starts with "sk-or-..."
#    - Optional: Add credits to your account (pay-as-you-go, very affordable)
#
# 3. EDIT YOUR .env FILE:
#    - Replace "sk-or-your-key-here" with your real OpenRouter key
#    - Keep the quotes around the key!
#    - Adjust other settings as you learn and grow
#
# 4. NEVER SHARE YOUR .env FILE:
#    - It contains your secret keys
#    - Anyone with your keys can use your AI credits
#    - Always keep .env in your .gitignore file
#
# 5. TEST YOUR SETUP:
#    python main.py

# ============================================================================
# THE DEEPER WISDOM OF CONFIGURATION
# ============================================================================
#
# This file teaches several important principles:
#
# 🔐 SEPARATION OF CONCERNS
# We separate what the code needs to know (variable names) from what
# should remain private (actual values). This is like having a recipe
# that calls for "secret sauce" without revealing the recipe for the sauce.
#
# 🎛️ CONFIGURATION AS CODE
# By making settings explicit and documented, we turn invisible assumptions
# into visible choices. Every setting becomes a conscious decision rather
# than a hidden default.
#
# 🛡️ SECURITY BY DESIGN
# We build security into the foundation rather than adding it as an afterthought.
# The .env pattern makes it almost impossible to accidentally commit secrets.
#
# 🔄 FLEXIBILITY AND EVOLUTION
# As you grow and experiment, you can easily switch models, adjust settings,
# and add new capabilities without changing your core code. The configuration
# becomes a control panel for your AI adventures.
#
# 🎓 PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES
# You're learning the same patterns used by professional developers at
# companies around the world. These skills transfer to any project you'll
# ever build.
#
# Remember: Good configuration is like good architecture - it anticipates
# change while providing stability, offers flexibility while maintaining
# simplicity, and makes the invisible visible.
